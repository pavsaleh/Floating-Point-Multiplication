# Floating-Point-Multiplication
Designing and building a floating-point multiplier in VHDL

Fixed-point arithmetic is fairly easy to comprehend and use. However, such a simplistic concept comes with its own limits. Operations dealing with numbers with fractions, very small numbers, or very large numbers cannot utilize fixed-point arithmetic. This is where floating-point arithmetic becomes extremely useful. The binary point is not fixed, hence its name. Floating-point numbers are composed of 3 components: The sign, the mantissa (the significant digits), and the exponent (the scale factor). This project details the design and implementation of an arithmetic unit capable of performing floating-point addition, as well as a floating-point multiplication.
